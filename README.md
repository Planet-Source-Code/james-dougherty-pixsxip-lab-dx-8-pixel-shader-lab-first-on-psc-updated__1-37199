### Description

This program will let you program Pixel Shaders. The program its self is pretty easy, but programming pixel shaders is kind of tough. Considering it is asm. I made it so I could learn Pixel Shaders for my RPG game, to get rid of the seams in the textures. It comes with 13 shader examples (Samples button). In version 2 I want to make it more user friendly and try to make it easier to understand the functions. Please leave some comments and if you like it, please vote.
